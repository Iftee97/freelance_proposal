the proposal:

Dear hypothetical/fake business,

We looked closely at the hypothetical/fake business website, and put together some of our observations. 

Since everything start with the search, that's where we started. When we typed "hypothetical/fake business" we could not find you on page 1 or page 2 of google. 

One of the things we noticed when we tried to load your site on a phone, is that it looked like this (screenshot attached). We had to zoom and pan around, and it seemed to be the same thing you'd see on a desktop or laptop computer, just scrunched down and difficult to browse. 

I'd love to collaborate with your team to build a site that represents the quality of your design and firm, and would be thrilled at the opportunity to earn your business. 

Sincerely,
your_name_here
